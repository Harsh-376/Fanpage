                    At Grace Field House, life couldn't be better for the orphans! Though they have no parents,together
                    with the other kids and a kind "Mama" who cares for them, they form one big, happy family. No child
                    is
                    ever overlooked, especially since they are all adopted by the age of 12. Their daily lives involve
                    rigorous tests, but afterwards, they are allowed to play outside. There is only one rule they must
                    obey:
                    do not leave the orphanage. But one day, two top-scoring orphans, Emma and Norman, venture past the
                    gate
                    and unearth the horrifying reality behind their entire existence: they are all livestock, and their
                    orphanage is a farm to cultivate food for a mysterious race of demons. With only a few months left
                    to
                    pull off an escape plan, the children must somehow change their

                    — Ray to Emma in "The Promised Forest"<br><br>
                    Ray is a model student of Grace Field House, who consistently gets perfect scores during the
                    daily exams. He is also known for being an avid reader with high intellectual abilities, blunt
                    skepticism, and cunning. Despite his distant disposition, Ray is able to interact well with the
                    orphans and is fiercely loyal and caring to particularly Emma and Norman.
                    <br>
                    Being one of the smartest children living in Grace Field, Ray is considered to be one of Grace
                    Field House's three "Premium quality goods" next to Norman and Emma.
                    <br>
                    After his success of escaping Grace Field alongside Emma and 13 other orphans, Ray now seeks
                    William Minerva, whom he believes can grant him and his family liberty and help them find a safe
                    and peaceful life away from the demons.

                    Caring and extroverted, Emma often proves herself to be one of the most reliable orphans and is
                    often seen surrounded by friends. She is known for her incredible ability to learn, capable
                    athleticism, and ample optimism.
                    <br>
                    Emma is the main character of the series and one of the three oldest children living at Grace Field
                    House. Like Ray and Norman, she is 11-years-old and consistently gets perfect scores during their
                    daily exams. She is identified by her ID number 63194 and known for her ample optimism as well as
                    her capable athleticism.

                    After her success of escaping Grace Field alongside Ray and 13 other orphans, Emma seeks to find

                    — Norman in "My Burden"<br><br>
                    Norman is a math prodigy and a model student of Grace Field House, with intelligence that surpasses
                    his peers and even adults. He is also known for being a genius strategist and planner, as well as
                    unbeatable at the game of tag.
                    <br>
                    When he discovers the truth about the orphanage with Emma, he teams up with her and Ray to devise a
                    plan to escape. Norman is, however, forced to be shipped before his 12th birthday, and he sacrifices
                    himself and accepts his fate of inevitable death to let his family escape.
                    <br>
                    In reality, Norman was transferred to an experimentation plantation called Λ7214. One-and-a-half
                    years later, he managed to escape and destroy Λ7214 along with his new-found comrades. Witnessing
                    the true horrors of the farm system, Norman hoped to completely annihilate all demons and create a
                    sanctuary for all humans in the demon world.

                    Isabella worked as a caretaker in Grace Field House, taking care of the orphans that resides within.
                    Although initially appearing as a loving and affectionate mother towards the children, she actually
                    has a twisted nature and shows much detachment to their tragic fates.
                    <br>
                    After Emma, Ray, and 13 other orphans escaped from Grace Field House, Isabella accepted defeat and
                    as her antagonism ceased, she wished them farewell as she watched the children leave.
                    <br>
                    Despite letting 15 children escape from the farm, Peter Ratri and the higher-ups decided to ship out
                    Sarah and promote Isabella to the Grandmother of Grace Field instead. Isabella, however, planned to
                    betray Peter from the very start, confident that her children would come back and that she could
                    help them once that day arrived.

                    — Krone about Emma, Norman and Ray in "021145"<br><br>
                    She was a caretaker who helped run the Grace Field House orphanage with Isabella. She would
                    eventually attempt to usurp the position of "Mama" from Isabella, an act which would lead to her
                    death at the hands of Isabella, Grandmother and the Demons.
                    <br><br>
                    Krone also appeared to be a prideful woman with a strong hatred towards the farm system. Although
                    she accepted her death with a smile, she went down with the thoughts of spiting Isabella, since she
                    knew that the orphans still had a chance to escape and eventually get "revenge" on Isabella, and
                    destroy the system she had hated so much.

                    — Don to Emma in "311045"<br><br>
                    Don is a 10-year-old orphan who formerly resided in the Grace Field House. Being one of the smartest
                    children after Emma, Norman, and Ray, Don is considered as one of Grace Field House's "good quality
                    goods". A cheerful but impulsive boy who cares greatly about his family, particularly Conny, he is
                    brought into the escape plan alongside Gilda after the truth of the orphanage is revealed.
                    <br>
                    After his success of escaping Grace Field alongside 14 other orphans, Don now seeks to find William
                    Minerva, whom he and his team believe can grant them the liberty to live a safe and peaceful life
                    away from the demons.

                        Being one of the smartest children after Emma, Norman, and Ray, Gilda is considered as one of
                        Grace Field House's "good quality goods". A quiet but firm girl, she is brought into the escape

                <p>
                    <span>Conny was one of the orphans at the Grace Field House where she lived her life comfortably and
                        surrounded by all her siblings who loved her. She was especially close to Don. On October 12,
                        2045, Conny left the orphanage since Conny's foster mother, Isabella, had revealed that some
                        nice people willing to "adopt" Conny had been found.
                        <br><br>
                        While Isabella accompanied Conny to the gates of the orphanage, she sang her a lullaby to which
                        Conny questioned her what song it was. When she was sent out from the house, Emma and Norman
                        noticed that Conny had left her favorite plush, Little Bunny behind, so they immediately tried
                        to catch up and deliver it to her. However, they found that Conny had not been sent away to get
                        adopted, but she had been harvested by the Demons to become food. They saw a strange flower
                        sticking out of her chest which had killed her instantly. Discovering her corpse is what lead
                        Emma and Norman to discover the orphanage's true nature.
